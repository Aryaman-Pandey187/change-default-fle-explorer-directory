This trick has one limitation. 
In order for this trick to work, you must have File Explorer pinned to the Taskbar, If you don’t know how to do that, open any folder of your choice, right-click its icon on the taskbar, and select Pin to taskbar from the context menu.


Navigate to the folder that you want File Explorer to open. Right-click on it and select Send to>Desktop (create shortcut). Go to your desktop and edit the name of the shortcut so that it’s File Explorer.

Open File Explorer and paste the following in the location bar: %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\User Pinned\TaskBar


This will open File Explorer to the location where pinned taskbar items are saved. Cut and paste the shortcut you created for your folder and paste it in the folder with the pinned taskbar items.

and its DONE.

Now whenver you open file explorer from the taskbar, it will open to your desired location.
